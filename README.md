# Switchgrass üåæ
A homegrown python framework for building CLI applications

‚ö†Ô∏è This framework is currently in Alpha. Use only for testing ‚ö†Ô∏è

### What?
The idea is to make all the input, output, and state management of a CLI program easier. So the goal of this project is to build a package that allows developers to build CLIs, representing different menus as nodes on a graph.

_We'll see how this goes_

Wish me luck!

### Try it out
If you want to try it out, I'll release versions of this periodically. You can download the newest version with pip!

`pip install switchgrass`

You can also check it out on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/switchgrass/)
