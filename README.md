# Switchgrass ðŸŒ¾
A homegrown python framework for building CLI applications

### What?
The idea is to make all the input, output, and state management of a CLI program easier. So the goal of this project is to build a package that allows developers to build CLIs, representing different menus as nodes on a graph.

_We'll see how this goes_

Wish me luck!
